  <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
  <p  class="text">The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is
    filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole. You
    can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on
    the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.</p>
    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">1 pound ground beef</li>

      <li class="text">2 avocados</li>
      
      <li class="text">1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
      
      <li class="text">1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
      
      <li class="text">salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      
      <li class="text">2 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      
      <li class="text">2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      
      <li class="text">1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
      
  <li class="text">1 large tomato, chopped</li>
  
  <li class="text">¼red onion, chopped</li>
  
  <li class="text">½ cup sour cream</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over
    the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15
    minutes. Drain the excess grease.
  </li>
  
  <li class="text">Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet.
    Heat
    the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</li>
    
    <li class="text">Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the
      preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
      
      <li class="text">To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime
        juice,
        and salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.</li>
        
        <li class="text">To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla
          gently around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell,
          and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded
          lettuce,
          a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</li>
