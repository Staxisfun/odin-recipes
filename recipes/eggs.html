<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These baked scrambled eggs are light and fluffy and are a snap to put together for a big crowd. I usually make two
  pans for our Christmas brunch, and I never have many leftovers!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup butter or margarine, melted</li>

  <li>24 eggs</li>

  <li>2 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>

  <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

  <li>Pour melted butter into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>

  <li>Whisk together eggs and salt in a large bowl until well-blended. Gradually whisk in milk. Pour egg mixture into
    the buttered dish.</li>

  <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir egg mixture and continue to bake until eggs are set, 10
    to 15 minutes more.</li>

</ol>
